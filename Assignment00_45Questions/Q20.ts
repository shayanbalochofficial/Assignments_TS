//* Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
let array: string[] = ['Fairy Meadows', 'Nile', 'Italia', 'Barcelona'];
array.forEach((local, index) => {
    console.log(`${index + 1}. ${local}`);
});
