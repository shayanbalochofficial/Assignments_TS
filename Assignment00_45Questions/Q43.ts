//* Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 40. Call the function make_great() with a copy of the array of magicians’ names. Because the original array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array. Call show_magicians() with each array to show that you have one array of the original names and one array with the Great added to each magician’s name.

// function make__great(Magicians: string[]) {
//   for (const magician of Magicians) {
//     console.log(`The Great ${magician}`);
//   }
//   return make__great;
// }
// let magician__Names: string[] = ["David Smith", "John Smith", "Weekend"];

// make__great(magician__Names);
